function C = chebspec_demo(N)

%   C = CHEBSPEC_DEMO(N) returns matrix C of
%   dimension N.
%
%   C is the Chebyshev spectral differentiation matrix of
%   dimension N [1] of the first derivative operator d/dx
%   on [-1,1] with boundary condition u(1)=0.
%   The pseudospectra of the infinite dimensional operator
%   consist of half-planes, which is suggested in this
%   low-dimensional discretization by the straight lines
%   that form the rightmost part of each pseudospectral
%   boundary [2].
